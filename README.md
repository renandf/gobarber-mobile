# GoBarber
GoBarber is a fictitious project created as part of the GoStack course from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). GoStack is a course covering _React JS_, _React Native_, and _Node.js_. The project is composed of:

- **GoBarber mobile** (this project) - the mobile app which allows users to create an account and book appointments with "barbers".
- **[GoBarber web](https://gobarber.renancastro.com/)** - [GitHub](https://github.com/renandf/gobarber-web) - an online app for "barbers" to be able to see their schedule of appointments.
- **GoBarber API** - [GitHub](https://github.com/renandf/gobarber-backend) - the back-end portion of the GoBarber project responsible for saving data from the mobile and web apps into the database and also feeding data into those apps.

## GoBarber mobile
The goal of this app is to allow people looking for "barbers" (service providers) with availability so they can book an appointment time.

**Highlighted features and technology:**

- Covers a full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) scenario communicating with custom API
- Registration flow with validation examples
- Flow to reset password including email with a tokenized link
